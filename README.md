# The National Vulnerability Intelligence Platform (NVIP)
The National Vulnerability Intelligence Platform (NVIP) provides a near real time vulnerability detection and analysis platform with the following features:
- Real-time CVE crawling
- Using AI/ML for near real-time characterization of CVEs. 
- Characterization of CVEs in five domains defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Vulnerability Description Ontology (VDO) framework.
- Automated CVSS scoring
- Product name and version (CPE) identification 

NVIP is a public project and all of its source code and datasets are available on [Github](https://github.com/SoftwareDesignLab/vulnerability-intelligence-platform).

This repo provides a Vagrant script to prepare an Ubuntu Virtual Machine (VM) for NVIP. The goal is to simplify the deployment process to a single Vagrant command.

# Create a VM for NVIP
This repo provides a Vagrantfile to pull the NVIP project from GitHub, and create a VM that includes everything needed to run it.
> **16G RAM is needed for the VM that includes Ubuntu OS 20 (4G), MySQL (4G) and the NVIP system (8G) which trains and deserializes AI/ML models**  
## User Guide
- Clone the project and run "vagrant up nvip".

> If you do not have Vagrant installed please install it from https://www.vagrantup.com
